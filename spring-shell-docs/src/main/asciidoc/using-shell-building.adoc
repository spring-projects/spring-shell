=== Building

This section covers how to build a Spring Shell application.

[[native]]
==== Native Support

Version 2.1.x includes experimental support for compiling Spring Shell applications
into native applications with GraalVM and Spring Native. Because the underlying JLine
library works with GraalVM, most things should just work.

You can compile the project with a native profile to get a native application:

====
----
$ ./mvnw clean package -Pnative
----
====

You can then run the application in either interactive or non-interactive mode:

====
----
$ ./spring-shell-samples/target/spring-shell-samples help
