There are two different ways to define a command: through an annotation model and
through a programmatic model. In the annotation model, you define your methods
in a class and annotate the class and the methods with specific annotations.
In the programmatic model, you use a more low level approach, defining command
registrations (either as beans or by dynamically registering with a command catalog).
