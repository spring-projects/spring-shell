=== Flow
ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

When you use <<using-shell-components-ui>> to build something that involves
use of a multiple components, your implementation may become a bit cluttered.
To ease these use cases, we added a
`ComponentFlow` that can hook multiple component executions together
as a "`flow`".

The following listings show examples of flows and their output in a shell:

====

include::{snippets}/FlowComponentSnippets.java[tag=snippet2]

TIP: The result from running a flow returns `ComponentFlowResult`, which you can
use to do further actions.
