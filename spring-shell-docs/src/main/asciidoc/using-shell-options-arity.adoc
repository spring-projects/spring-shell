Sometimes, you want to have more fine control of how many parameters with an option
are processed when parsing operations happen. Arity is defined as min and max
values, where min must be a positive integer and max has to be more or equal to min.

Arity can also be defined as an `OptionArity` enum, which are shortcuts
within the following table:

|Value |min/max

|ZERO
|0 / 0

|ZERO_OR_ONE
|0 / 1

|EXACTLY_ONE
|1 / 1

|ZERO_OR_MORE
| 0 / Integer MAX

|ONE_OR_MORE
|1 / Integer MAX

The annotation model supports defining only the max value of an arity.
