==== Dynamic Command Availability

Registered commands do not always make sense, due to the internal state of the application.
For example, there may be a `download` command, but it only works once the user has used `connect` on a remote
server. Now, if the user tries to use the `download` command, the shell should explain that
the command exists but that it is not available at the time.
Spring Shell lets you do that, even letting you provide a short explanation of the reason for
the command not being available.

There are three possible ways for a command to indicate availability.
They all use a no-arg method that returns an instance of `Availability`.
Consider the following example:

====
[source, java]
----
@ShellComponent
public class MyCommands {

    private boolean connected;

    @ShellMethod("Connect to the server.")
    public void connect(String user, String password) {
        [...]
        connected = true;
    }

    @ShellMethod("Download the nuclear codes.")
    public void download() {
        [...]
    }

    public Availability downloadAvailability() {
        return connected
            ? Availability.available()
            : Availability.unavailable("you are not connected");
    }
}
----
====

The `connect` method is used to connect to the server (details omitted), altering the state
of the command through the `connected` boolean when done.
The `download` command as marked as unavailable until the user has connected, thanks to the presence
of a method named exactly as the `download` command method with the `Availability` suffix in its name.
The method returns an instance of `Availability`, constructed with one of the two factory methods.
If the command is not available, an explanation has to be provided.
Now, if the user tries to invoke the command while not being connected, here is what happens:

====
[source]
----
shell:>download
Command 'download' exists but is not currently available because you are not connected.
Details of the error have been omitted. You can use the stacktrace command to print the full stacktrace.
----
====

Information about currently unavailable commands is also used in the integrated help. See <<help-command>>.

[TIP]
====
The reason provided when the command is not available should read nicely if appended after "`Because`".

You should not start the sentence with a capital or add a final period
====

If naming the availability method after the name of the command method does not suit you, you
can provide an explicit name by using the `@ShellMethodAvailability` annotation:

====
[source, java]
----
    @ShellMethod("Download the nuclear codes.")
    @ShellMethodAvailability("availabilityCheck") // <1>
    public void download() {
        [...]
    }

    public Availability availabilityCheck() { // <1>
        return connected
            ? Availability.available()
            : Availability.unavailable("you are not connected");
    }
----
<1> the names have to match
====

Finally, it is often the case that several commands in the same class share the same internal state and, thus,
should all be available or unavailable as a group. Instead of having to stick the `@ShellMethodAvailability`
on all command methods, Spring Shell lets you flip things around and put the `@ShellMethodAvailabilty`
annotation on the availability method, specifying the names of the commands that it controls:

====
[source, java]
----
    @ShellMethod("Download the nuclear codes.")
    public void download() {
        [...]
    }

    @ShellMethod("Disconnect from the server.")
    public void disconnect() {
        [...]
    }

    @ShellMethodAvailability({"download", "disconnect"})
    public Availability availabilityCheck() {
        return connected
            ? Availability.available()
            : Availability.unavailable("you are not connected");
    }
----
====

[TIP]
=====
The default value for the `@ShellMethodAvailability.value()` attribute is `*`. This special
wildcard matches all command names. This makes it easy to turn all commands of a single class on or off
with a single availability method:

====
[source,java]
----
@ShellComponent
public class Toggles {
  @ShellMethodAvailability
  public Availability availabilityOnWeekdays() {
    return Calendar.getInstance().get(DAY_OF_WEEK) == SUNDAY
      ? Availability.available()
      : Availability.unavailable("today is not Sunday");
  }

  @ShellMethod
  public void foo() {}

  @ShellMethod
  public void bar() {}
}
----
====
=====

TIP: Spring Shell does not impose many constraints on how to write commands and how to organize classes.
However, it is often good practice to put related commands in the same class, and the availability indicators
can benefit from that.
