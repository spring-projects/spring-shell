=== Command Catalog
The `CommandCatalog` interface defines how command registrations exist in
a shell application. It is possible to dynamically register and de-register
commands, which gives flexibility for use cases where possible commands
come and go, depending on a shell's state. Consider the following example:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/CommandCatalogSnippets.java[tag=snippet1]
----
====

==== Command Resolver
You can implement the `CommandResolver` interface and define a bean to dynamically
resolve mappings from a command's name to its `CommandRegistration` instances. Consider
the following example:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/CommandCatalogSnippets.java[tag=snippet2]
----
====

IMPORTANT: A current limitation of a `CommandResolver` is that it is used every time commands are resolved.
Thus, we advise not using it if a command resolution call takes a long time, as it would
make the shell feel sluggish.

==== Command Catalog Customizer
You can use the `CommandCatalogCustomizer` interface to customize a `CommandCatalog`.
Its main use is to modify a catalog. Also, within `spring-shell` auto-configuration, this
interface is used to register existing `CommandRegistration` beans into a catalog.
Consider the following example:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/CommandCatalogSnippets.java[tag=snippet3]
----
====

You can create a `CommandCatalogCustomizer` as a bean, and Spring Shell handles the rest.
