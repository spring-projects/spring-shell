[[built-in-commands]]
==== Built-In Commands

Any application built by using the `{starter-artifactId}` artifact
(which equates to the `spring-shell-standard-commands` dependency) comes with a set of built-in commands.
You can override or disable these commands individually (see <<overriding-or-disabling-built-in-commands>>).
However, if they are not overridden or disabled, this section describes their behavior.

[[help-command]]
===== Help

Running a shell application often implies that the user is in a graphically limited
environment. Also, while we are nearly always connected in the era of mobile phones,
accessing a web browser or any other rich UI application (such as a PDF viewer) may not always
be possible. This is why it is important that the shell commands are correctly self-documented, and this is where the `help`
command comes in.

Typing `help` + `ENTER` lists all the commands known to the shell (including <<dynamic-command-availability,unavailable>> commands)
and a short description of what they do, similar to the following:

====
[source, bash]
----
my-shell:>help
AVAILABLE COMMANDS

Built-In Commands
       exit: Exit the shell.
       help: Display help about available commands
       stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error.
       clear: Clear the shell screen.
       quit: Exit the shell.
       history: Display or save the history of previously run commands
       completion bash: Generate bash completion script
       version: Show version info
       script: Read and execute commands from a file.
----
====

Typing `help <command>` shows more detailed information about a command, including the available parameters, their
type, whether they are mandatory or not, and other details.

The following listing shows the `help` command applied to itself:

====
[source, bash]
----
my-shell:>help help
NAME
       help - Display help about available commands

SYNOPSIS
       help --command String

OPTIONS
       --command or -C String
       The command to obtain help for.
       [Optional]
----
====

Help is templated and can be customized if needed. Settings are under `spring.shell.command.help` where you can use
`enabled` to disable command, `grouping-mode` taking `group` or `flat` if you want to hide groups by flattening
a structure, `command-template` to define your template for output of a command help, `commands-template` to define
output of a command list.

If `spring.shell.command.help.grouping-mode=flat` is set, then help would show:

====
[source, bash]
----
my-shell:>help help
AVAILABLE COMMANDS

exit: Exit the shell.
help: Display help about available commands
stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error.
clear: Clear the shell screen.
quit: Exit the shell.
history: Display or save the history of previously run commands
completion bash: Generate bash completion script
version: Show version info
script: Read and execute commands from a file.
----

===== Clear
The `clear` command does what you would expect and clears the screen, resetting the prompt
in the top left corner.

===== Exit

The `quit` command (also aliased as `exit`) requests the shell to quit, gracefully
closing the Spring application context. If not overridden, a JLine `History` bean writes a history of all
commands to disk, so that they are available again (see <<interacting-with-the-shell>>) on the next launch.

===== Stacktrace

When an exception occurs inside command code, it is caught by the shell and a simple, one-line message is displayed
so as not to overflow the user with too much information.
There are cases, though, when understanding what exactly happened is important (especially if the exception has a nested cause).

To this end, Spring Shell remembers the last exception that occurred, and the user can later use the `stacktrace`
command to print all the details on the console.

[[script-command]]
===== Script

The `script` command accepts a local file as an argument and replays commands found there, one at a time.

Reading from the file behaves exactly like inside the interactive shell, so lines starting with `//` are considered
to be comments and are ignored, while lines ending with `\` trigger line continuation.

===== History

The `history` command shows the history of commands that has been executed.

There are a few configuration options that you can use to configure behavior
of a history. History is kept in a log file, which is enabled by default and can
be turned off by setting `spring.shell.history.enabled`. The name of a log file
is resolved from `spring.application.name` and defaults to `spring-shell.log`,
which you can change by setting `spring.shell.history.name`.

By default, a log file is generated to a current working directory, which you can dictate
by setting `spring.shell.config.location`. This property can contain
a placeholder (`{userconfig}`), which resolves to a common shared config directory.

TIP: Run the Spring Shell application to see how the sample application works as it uses these options.

===== Completion

The `completion` command set lets you create script files that can be used
with am OS shell implementations to provide completion. This is very useful when
working with non-interactive mode.

Currently, the only implementation is for bash, which works with `bash` sub-command.

===== Version

The `version` command shows existing build and git info by integrating into
Boot's `BuildProperties` and `GitProperties` if those exist in the shell application.
By default, only version information is shown, and you can enable other information through configuration
options.

The relevant settings are under `spring.shell.command.version`, where you can use `enabled` to
disable a command and, optionally, define your own template with `template`. You can use the
`show-build-artifact`, `show-build-group`, `show-build-name`, `show-build-time`,
`show-build-version`, `show-git-branch`, `show-git-commit-id`,
`show-git-short-commit-id` and `show-git-commit-time` commands to control
fields in a default template.

The template defaults to `classpath:template/version-default.st`, and you can define
your own, as the following example shows:

====
[source]
----
<buildVersion>
----
====

This setting would output something like the following:

====
[source]
----
X.X.X
----
====

You can add the following attributes to the default template rendering: `buildVersion`, `buildGroup`,
`buildGroup`, `buildName`, `buildTime`, `gitShortCommitId`, `gitCommitId`,
`gitBranch`, and `gitCommitTime`.
