==== Validation

Spring Shell integrates with the https://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation API] to support
automatic and self-documenting constraints on command parameters.

Annotations found on command parameters as well as annotations at the method level are
honored and trigger validation prior to the command executing. Consider the following command:

====
[source, java]
----
	@ShellMethod("Change password.")
	public String changePassword(@Size(min = 8, max = 40) String password) {
		return "Password successfully set to " + password;
	}
----
====

From the preceding example, you get the following behavior for free:

====
----
shell:>change-password hello
The following constraints were not met:
	--password string : size must be between 8 and 40 (You passed 'hello')
----
====

[NOTE]
.Applies to All Command Implementations
====
It is important to note that bean validation applies to all command implementations,
whether they use the "standard" API or any other API, through the use of an adapter
(see <<support-for-shell-1-and-jcommander,Supporting Other APIs>>)
