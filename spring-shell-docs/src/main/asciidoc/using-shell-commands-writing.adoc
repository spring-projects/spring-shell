=== Writing
ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

When something needs to get written into your console you can always
use JDK's `System.out` which then goes directly into JDK's own streams.
Other recommended way is to use JLine's `Terminal` and get _writer_
instance from there.

If using target enpoints, i.e. _consumer_ which is not expected
to return anything given `CommandContext` contains reference to
`Terminal` and writer can be accessed from there.

It's possible to autowire `Terminal` to get access to its writer.
