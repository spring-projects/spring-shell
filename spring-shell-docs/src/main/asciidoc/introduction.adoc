== What is Spring Shell?
Not all applications need a fancy web user interface.
Sometimes, interacting with an application through an interactive terminal is
the most appropriate way to get things done.

Spring Shell lets you create such a runnable application, where the
user enters textual commands that are run until the program terminates.
The Spring Shell project provides the infrastructure to create such a REPL (Read, Eval,
Print Loop) application, letting you concentrate on implementing commands by using
the familiar Spring programming model.

Spring Shell includes advanced features (such as parsing, tab completion, colorization of 
output, fancy ASCII-art table display, input conversion, and validation), freeing you
to focus on core command logic.
