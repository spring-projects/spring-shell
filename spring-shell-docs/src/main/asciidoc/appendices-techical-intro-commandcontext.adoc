=== Command Context
The `CommandContext` interface gives access to a currently running
context. You can use it to get access to options:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/CommandContextSnippets.java[tag=snippet1]
----
====

If you need to print something into a shell, you can get a `Terminal`
and use its writer to print something:

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/CommandContextSnippets.java[tag=snippet2]
----
