=== Commands
ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

In this section, we go through an actual command registration and leave command options
and execution for later in a documentation. You can find more detailed info in
<<appendix-tech-intro-registration>>.

There are two different ways to define a command: through an annotation model and
through a programmatic model. In the annotation model, you define your methods
in a class and annotate the class and the methods with specific annotations. In the programmatic model,
you use a more low level approach, defining command registrations (either
as beans or by dynamically registering with a command catalog).
