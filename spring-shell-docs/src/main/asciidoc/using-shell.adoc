== Using Spring Shell
This section describes how to use Spring Shell.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Spring Shell 2.1.x is a major rework to bring the codebase up to date with
existing Spring Boot versions, adding new features and, especially,
making it work with GraalVM which makes command-line applications much
more relevant in a Java space. Moving to a new major version also lets
us clean up the codebase and make some needed breaking changes.
