=== Search Algorithms

`SearchMatch` is an interface to match _text_ with a _pattern_. Match
results are in a returned value `SearchMatchResult`. Match result
contains info about match positions and overall score of a match.

==== Implementations

*FuzzyMatchV2Search*

Port of _fzf FuzzyMatchV2Search_ algorithm. Does a fast fuzzy search and is good
quickly finding paths.

*ExactMatchNaive*

Port of _fzf ExactMatchNaive_ algorithm. Simple exact match works more accurately
if you know what to search.

==== SearchMatch

Algorithms and default syntax are hidden inside package protected classes
as we don't want to fully open these until we know API's are good to go
for longer support. You need to construct `SearchMatch` via its
build-in builder.

It's possible to configure _case sensitivity_, on what _direction_ search
happens or if text should be _normilized_ before search happens. Normalization
is handy when different languages have sligh variation for same type
of characters.

Search algorithm is selected based on a search syntax shown in
below table.

.Search syntax
|===
|Token |Match type |Description

|`hell`
|fuzzy-match
|Items that match `hello`

|`'stuff`
|exact-match
|Items that include `stuff`
