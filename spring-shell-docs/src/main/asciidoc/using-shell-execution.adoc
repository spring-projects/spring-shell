== Execution

This section describes how to set up a Spring Shell to work in interactive mode.

=== Interaction Mode

Version 2.1.x introduced built-in support to distinguish between interactive
and non-interactive modes. This makes it easier to use the shell as a
simple command-line tool without requiring customization.

Currently, interactive mode is entered if any command line options are passed when starting
or running a shell from a command line. This works especially well when a shell application
is compiled with <<native>>.

Some commands may not have any useful meanings when they run in interactive mode
or (conversely) in non-interactive mode. For example, a built-in `exit` command would
have no meaning in non-interactive mode, because it is used to exit interactive mode.

The `@ShellMethod` annotation has a field called `interactionMode` that you can use to inform
shell about when a particular command is available.
