If your shell application is made for exactly a single purpose having only one
command, it may be beneficial to configure it for this. If the property
`spring.shell.noninteractive.primary-command` is defined, it will disable all other
runners than `NonInteractiveShellRunner` and configures it to use the defined _Primary Command_.

[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  shell:
    noninteractive:
      primary-command: mycommand
----

For example, if you have a command `mycommand` with option `arg`
that is expected to be executed with `<shellapp> mycommand --arg hi` in a multi-command app,
then with the above configuration it can be executed with `<shellapp> --arg hi`.
