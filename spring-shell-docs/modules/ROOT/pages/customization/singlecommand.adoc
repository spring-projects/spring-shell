If your shell application is made for exactly a single purpose having only one
command it may be beneficial to configure it for this. Property
`spring.shell.noninteractive.primary-command` if defined will disable all other
runners than `NonInteractiveShellRunner` and configures it to use
defined _Primary Command_.

[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  shell:
    noninteractive:
      primary-command: mycommand
----

For example if you have a command `mycommand` with option `arg`
it had to be executed with `<shellapp> mycommand --arg hi`, but with above
setting it can be executed with `<shellapp> --arg hi`.
