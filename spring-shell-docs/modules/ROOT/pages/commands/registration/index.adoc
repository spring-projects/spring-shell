There are two different ways to define a command: through an annotation model and
through a programmatic model. In the annotation model, you define your methods
in a class and annotate the class and the methods with specific annotations.
In the programmatic model, you use a more low level approach, defining command
registrations (either as beans or by dynamically registering with a command catalog).

Starting from _3.1.x_ a better support for defining commands using
xref:commands/registration/annotation.adoc[annotations] were added. Firstly because eventually standard
package providing xref:commands/registration/legacyannotation.adoc[legacy annotations] will get deprecated
and removed. Secondly so that we're able to provide same set of features than using underlying
`CommandRegistration`. Creating a new annotation model allows us to rethink and modernise that
part without breaking existing applications.
