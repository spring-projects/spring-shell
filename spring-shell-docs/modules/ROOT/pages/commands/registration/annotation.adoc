The `@Command` annotation marks a method as a candidate for command registration.
In below example a command `example` is defined.

Using a `@Command` will not automatically register command targets, instead it is required to use
`@EnableCommand` annotations. This model is familiar from other parts
of Spring umbrella and provides better flexibility for a user being inclusive rather than exclusive
for command targets.

You can define target classes using `@EnableCommand`. It will get picked from all _Configuration_
classes.

TIP: `@EnableCommand` is not required in a Spring Boot application, as Spring Boot auto-configuration
will take care of that.
