In the programmatic model, `CommandRegistration` can be defined as a `@Bean`
and it will be automatically registered.

If all your commands have something in common, an instance of
a _CommandRegistration.BuilderSupplier_ is created which can
be autowired. Default implementation of this supplier returns
a new builder so you don't need to worry about its internal state.

IMPORTANT: Commands registered programmatically automatically
add _help options_ mentioned in xref:commands/helpoptions.adoc[Help Options].

If a bean of this supplier type is defined then auto-configuration
will back off giving you an option to redefine default functionality.

`CommandRegistrationCustomizer` beans can be defined if you want to centrally
modify builder instance given to you by a supplier as mentioned below:
