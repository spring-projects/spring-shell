In the programmatic model, commands can be defined as beans of type `Command`:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/CommandRegistrationBeanSnippets.java[tag=plain]
----

You can also use the `AbstractCommand` class to simplify command definitions:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/CommandRegistrationBeanSnippets.java[tag=abstractcommand]
----

`AbstractCommand` provides some utility methods to simplify command creation like
handling help options (`-h` and `--help`) and printing messages to the shell output.
