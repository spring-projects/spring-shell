= Hidden Command

ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

It is possible to _hide_ a command which is convenient in cases where it is not yet ready for
prime time, or is meant for debugging purposes or you have any other reason you don't want to
advertise its presence.

A hidden command can be executed if you know it and its options. It is effectively removed
from:

* Help listing
* Help page for command return "unknown command"
* Command completion in interactive mode
* Bash completion

Below is an example of how to define _hidden_ command. It shows available builder methods
to define _hidden_ state.
