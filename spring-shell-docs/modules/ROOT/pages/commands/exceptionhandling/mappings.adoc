= Exit Code Mappings

Default behaviour of an exit codes is as:

- Errors from a command option parsing will result to a code of `2`
- Any generic error will result to a code of `1`
- Obviously in any other case will result to a code of `0`

Every `CommandRegistration` can define its own mappings between _Exception_ and _exit code_.
Spring shell uses a similar approach to `Spring Boot` regarding _exit code_ and simply
integrate into that.

Assuming there is an exception shown below which would be thrown from a command:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/ExitCodeSnippets.java[tag=my-exception-class]
----

It is possible to define a mapping function between `Throwable` and exit code. You can also
just configure a _class_ to _exit code_ which is just a syntactic sugar within configurations.

NOTE: Exit codes cannot be customized with annotation based configuration
