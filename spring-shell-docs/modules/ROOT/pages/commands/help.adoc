= Option Help

ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

It's common in many CLI frameworks for every command having options _--help_ and _-h_
to print out command help. _Spring Shell_ has a built-in `help` command.

Extensions of `AbstractCommand` will get help functionality (ie handling options
_--help_ and _-h_), which if present in a given command will automatically
short circuit command execution into an existing `help` command regardless
what other command-line options are typed.
