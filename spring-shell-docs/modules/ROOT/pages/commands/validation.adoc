= Option Validation

Spring Shell integrates with the https://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation API] to support
automatic and self-documenting constraints on command parameters.

Annotations found on command parameters are honored and trigger validation prior to the command executing.
Consider the following command:

[source, java]
----
@Command(name = "change-password", description = "Change password", group = "User Management",
		help = "A command that changes the user password. Usage: change-password [-p | --password]=<password>")
public String changePassword(
		@Option(shortName = 'p', longName = "password") @Size(min = 8, max = 40) String password) {
	return "Password successfully set to " + password;
}
----

From the preceding example, you get the following behavior for free:

[source, bash]
----
$>change-password --password=hello
The following constraints were not met:
	--password: size must be between 8 and 40
Error while executing command change-password: USAGE_ERROR
----
