If you need to read input from the shell, you can get the `InputReader` from the
`CommandContext` and use it to read input. You can find more details about reading
from a shell in the xref:commands/reading.adoc[] section.

If you need to print something into a shell, you can get a `PrintWriter` from
the `CommandContext` and use it to print text. You can find more details about
writing into a shell in the xref:commands/writing.adoc[] section.
