= Help

Running a shell application often implies that the user is in a graphically limited
environment. This is why it is important that the shell commands are correctly self-documented, and this is where the `help`
command comes in.

Typing `help` + `ENTER` lists all the commands known to the shell (including xref:commands/availability.adoc[unavailable] commands)
and a short description of what they do, similar to the following:

[source, bash]
----
my-shell:>help
AVAILABLE COMMANDS

Built-In Commands
       exit: Exit the shell.
       help: Display help about available commands
       stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error.
       clear: Clear the shell screen.
       quit: Exit the shell.
       history: Display or save the history of previously run commands
       completion bash: Generate bash completion script
       version: Show version info
       script: Read and execute commands from a file.
----

Typing `help <command>` shows more detailed information about a command, including the available parameters, their
type, whether they are mandatory or not, and other details.

The following listing shows the `help` command applied to itself:

[source, bash]
----
my-shell:>help help
NAME
       help - Display help about available commands

SYNOPSIS
       help --command String

OPTIONS
       --command or -C String
       The command to obtain help for.
       [Optional]
----

Help is templated and can be customized if needed. Settings are under `spring.shell.command.help` where you can use
`enabled` to disable command, `grouping-mode` taking `group` or `flat` if you want to hide groups by flattening
a structure, `command-template` to define your template for output of a command help, `commands-template` to define
output of a command list.

If `spring.shell.command.help.grouping-mode=flat` is set, then help would show:

[source, bash]
----
my-shell:>help help
AVAILABLE COMMANDS

exit: Exit the shell.
help: Display help about available commands
stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error.
clear: Clear the shell screen.
quit: Exit the shell.
history: Display or save the history of previously run commands
completion bash: Generate bash completion script
version: Show version info
script: Read and execute commands from a file.
----

Output from `help` and `help <commmand>` are both templated with a default implementation
which can be changed.

Option `spring.shell.command.help.commands-template` defaults to
`classpath:template/help-commands-default.stg` and is passed `GroupsInfoModel`
as a model.

Option `spring.shell.command.help.command-template` defaults to
`classpath:template/help-command-default.stg` and is passed `CommandInfoModel`
as a model.
