= Help

Running a shell application often implies that the user is in a graphically limited
environment. This is why it is important that the shell commands are correctly self-documented, and this is where the `help`
command comes in.

Typing `help` + `ENTER` lists all the commands known to the shell and a short description of what they do, similar to the following:

[source, bash]
----
my-shell:>help
Available commands:

Built-In Commands

Typing `<command> -h` or `<command> --help` shows more information about a command, including the available parameters, their
type, whether they are mandatory or not, and other details.
