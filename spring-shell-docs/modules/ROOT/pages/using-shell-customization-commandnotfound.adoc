On default a missing command is handled via `CommandNotFoundResultHandler`
and outputs a simple message:

[source, text]
----
shell:>missing
No command found for 'missing'
----

Internally `CommandNotFoundResultHandler` is using `CommandNotFoundMessageProvider`
which is a simple function taking a `ProviderContext` and returning a text
message. Below is an example what a custom message provider might look like.

It's possible to change this implementation by defining it as a bean.

`CommandNotFoundResultHandler` is a functional interface so it can
be writter as a lambda.
