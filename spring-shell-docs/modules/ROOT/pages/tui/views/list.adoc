_ListView_ is a base implementation providing functionality to draw a list of
_items_. _ListView_ inherits from xref:tui/views/box.adoc[].

_ListView<T>_ is typed as its _item_ and can take any object. Further _item_
processing happens in a _CellFactory_. For convenience, there is a support
for generic higher level list feature showing checked states as normal
_check_ and _radio_ types. Essentially what you can have is a list of
items which are shown as is, shown where any items can have a checked
state or only one item can have a checked state.

== Customisation

How individual cells are shown depends on a _CellFactory_. Default implementation
simply shows _item_ using its `toString()` method.

It can be customised by modifying a used _CellFactory_.

And set it as a factory:
