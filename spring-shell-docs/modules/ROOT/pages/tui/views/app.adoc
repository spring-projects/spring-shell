_AppView_ is a base implementation providing functionality to draw opinionated _application view_.
This view inherits from xref:tui/views/box.adoc[].

The generic idea is to have menu and status views which typically are xref:tui/views/menubar.adoc[] and
xref:tui/views/statusbar.adoc[] respectively. Main content view is then whatever user want to show
in it.
