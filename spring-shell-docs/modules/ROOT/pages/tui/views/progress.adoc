_ProgressView_ is a base implementation providing functionality to draw a progress information.
_ProgressView_ inherits from xref:tui/views/box.adoc[].

_ProgressView_ draws its content using concepts described below:

* _ProgressState_ contains various info about a runtime state
** _tickStart_: Lower bound of tick value
** _tickEnd_: Upper bound of tick value
** _tickValue_: Current tick value
** _running_: Running state, either true or false
** _startTime_: Start time in millis when progress was started
** _updateTime_: Last known time in millis when progress has updated
* _ProgressContext_ is a context used with _ProgressViewItem_
** _description_: The description given to progress
** _state_: The _ProgressState_
** _view_: The owning _ProgressView_
** _spinner_: The _Spinner_ representation used with _ProgressView_
** Other methods to help with item drawing
* _ProgressViewItem_: is a representation of a cell used in _ProgressView_

There are few build-in items namely `text`, `spinner` and `percent`.

Default _ProgressView_ gives you `text`, `spinner` and `percent`.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/ProgressViewSnippets.java[tag=default]
----

And looks like:

[asciinema,rows=1]
----
include::example$tui-progress-1.cast[]
----

== Customisation

Here are some examples for various customisations:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/ProgressViewSnippets.java[tag=allmixedalignandsize]
----

Align `text` and `spinner` to left and give them less space. Align `percent` to right
and give it remaining space.

[asciinema,rows=1]
----
include::example$tui-progress-2.cast[]
----

== Default Bindings
Does not have any default bindings.
