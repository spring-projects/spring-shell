Views have their own default bindings which can be changed.

You can subscribe to all key events:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{snippets}/KeyHandlingSnippets.java[tag=sample]
----

`KeyEvent` is a record containing information about a binding coming out
from a terminal.

Some views allow you to register hot keys which are processed before
normal key handling. More about this can be found in
xref:appendices/tui/viewdev.adoc#register-bindings[Register Bindings].
