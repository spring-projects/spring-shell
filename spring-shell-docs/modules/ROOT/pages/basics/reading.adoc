Throughout this documentation, we make references to configuring something by using
annotations or programmatic examples.

NOTE: There are two annotation models: the xref:commands/registration/annotation.adoc[annotations] model
referred to as the new annotation model, and the xref:commands/registration/legacyannotation.adoc[legacy annotations]
model referred to as the old legacy annotation model.

The old legacy annotation model mostly relates to the use of `@ShellMethod` and `@ShellOption` and
the new annotation model relates to the use of `@Command`.

The programmatic model is how things are actually registered, even if you use annotations.

NOTE: The documentation structure is getting revised to clarify how to provide configurations in separate ways.
