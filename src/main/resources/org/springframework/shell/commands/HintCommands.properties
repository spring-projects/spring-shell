topics=The following hints are available to help you use the vFabric shell:\r\r general, start, persistence, entities, fields, relationships, \r web mvc, finders, eclipse, logging, gwt\r\rJust type 'hint topic_name' (without quotes) to view a specific hint.

general=At this stage of the project, you have a few options:\r\r  * List all hint topics via 'hint topics'\r  * Create more fields with 'hint fields'\r  * Create more entities with 'hint entities'\r  * Create a web controller with 'hint web mvc'\r  * Create dynamic finders with 'hint finders'\r  * Setup your logging levels via 'hint logging'\r  * Run tests via Maven (type 'perform tests')\r  * Build a deployment artifact (type 'perform package')\r  * Learn about Eclipse integration by typing 'hint eclipse'\r  * Add support for Google Web Toolkit via 'hint gwt'\r  * Discover all Roo commands by typing 'help'

start=Welcome to the Spring Shell! To start your journey.....
persistence=Roo requires the installation of a persistence configuration,\rfor example, JPA or MongoDB.\r\rFor JPA, type 'jpa setup' and then hit ${completion_key} three times.\rWe suggest you type 'H' then ${completion_key} to complete "HIBERNATE".\rAfter the --provider, press ${completion_key} twice for database choices.\rFor testing purposes, type (or ${completion_key}) HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY.\rIf you press ${completion_key} again, you'll see there are no more options.\rAs such, you're ready to press ENTER to execute the command.\r\rOnce JPA is installed, type 'hint' and ENTER for the next suggestion.\n\nSimilarly, for MongoDB persistence, type 'mongo setup' and ENTER.
entities=You can create entities either via Roo or your IDE.\nUsing the Roo shell is fast and easy, especially thanks to the ${completion_key} completion.\r\rStart by typing 'ent' and then hitting ${completion_key} twice.\rEnter the --class in the form '~.domain.MyEntityClassName'\rIn Roo, '~' means the --topLevelPackage you specified via 'create project'.\r\rAfter specify a --class argument, press SPACE then ${completion_key}. Note nothing appears.\rBecause nothing appears, it means you've entered all mandatory arguments.\rHowever, optional arguments do exist for this command (and most others in Roo).\rTo see the optional arguments, type '--' and then hit ${completion_key}. Mostly you won't\nneed any optional arguments, but let's select the --testAutomatically option\nand hit ENTER. You can always use this approach to view optional arguments.\r\rAfter creating an entity, use 'hint' for the next suggestion.
fields=You can add fields to your entities using either Roo or your IDE.\n\nTo add a new field, type 'field' and then hit ${completion_key}. Be sure to select\nyour entity and provide a legal Java field name. Use ${completion_key} to find an entity\nname, and '~' to refer to the top level package. Also remember to use ${completion_key}\nto access each mandatory argument for the command.\n\nAfter completing the mandatory arguments, press SPACE, type '--' and then ${completion_key}.\nThe optional arguments shown reflect official JSR 303 Validation constraints.\nFeel free to use an optional argument, or delete '--' and hit ENTER.\n\nIf creating multiple fields, use the UP arrow to access command history.\n\nAfter adding your fields, type 'hint' for the next suggestion.\nTo learn about setting up many-to-one fields, type 'hint relationships'.
relationships=You create persistent relationships via 'field set' and 'field reference'.\n\nFor example, consider the typical Order <-> LineItem case:\n\n   ENTITY: Order            ENTITY: LineItem\n   Set<LineItem> items      Order order\n\nTo setup this relationship in Roo, you would use:\n\nfield set --fieldName items --class Order --type LineItem --mappedBy order\nfield reference --fieldName order --class LineItem --type Order --notNull\n\nLearn about fields addition using 'hint fields'.
web\ mvc=Creating RESTful Spring MVC web controllers is quick and easy using Roo.\nControllers can be made that automatically expose an entity. Alternately, we\ncan create a stub, empty controller for you to finish off.\n\nFor the former, type 'web mvc setup' and hit ENTER followed by 'web mvc scaffold' and hit ${completion_key} three times.\nThe --class is the controller name; it need not reflect an entity name.\nWe suggest putting controllers under a '~.web' package to improve maintenance.\nYou can also specify the --backingType the controller should expose.\n\nAfter creating a controller, use 'hint' for further suggestions.
finders=Roo can automatically create complex, type-safe finder methods.\n\nBe sure to add fields to your entity before creating finders.\nLearn how to add fields by typing 'hint fields'.\n\nTo view available finders, type 'finder list' then ${completion_key}.\nNext select your entity class and hit ENTER. Names are then displayed.\nYou can see even more finder combinations by using --depth 2 or higher.\n\nTo add a finder, type 'finder add' and hit ${completion_key} twice.\nSpecify a --finderName from the earlier displayed output of 'list finders for'.\n\nFor more hints, type 'hint' and hit ENTER.
eclipse=It's easy to use your project in Eclipse or SpringSource Tool Suite (STS).\r\rTo set this up, you'll need to use the command prompt and then Eclipse itself:\r\r  1. Start by typing 'exit', to leave the Roo shell\r  2. Type 'mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse' to create Eclipse project files\r  3. Load Eclipse, then File > Import > Existing Projects Into Workspace\r  4. Ensure AJDT 1.6.5 or above is installed in Eclipse\r  5. Enable Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > Refresh Automatically\r  6. Finally, restart Roo (type 'roo' at the OS prompt) and enter 'hint'\r\rPlease note if you have the m2eclipse plugin installed, you need only select\rImport > Maven Projects from the Eclipse Import menu.\r\rFor the best Eclipse experience, we recommend SpringSource Tool Suite (STS):\r\r  * Graphical editing of Roo commands\r  * No need to use the Roo shell\r  * Immediate importing of Roo projects\r  * Full Spring projects integration\r  * Many other productivity-increasing features\r\rDownload STS from http://springsource.com (it's free!).\r\rYou can also use 'perform eclipse' instead of leaving the Roo interface.
logging=You can easily configure logging levels in your project.\r\rRoo will update the log4j.properties file to control your logging.\r\rType 'logging setup' then hit ${completion_key} twice. We suggest 'DEBUG' level.\rYou may wish to specify the optional --package argument (defaults to 'ALL').\r\rRemember to type 'hint' for further hints and suggestions.
gwt=It's easy to create a GWT client in your project.\r\rJust type 'web gwt setup' and press ENTER.\r\rNote Roo's GWT support outputs GWT 2.2 applications.
