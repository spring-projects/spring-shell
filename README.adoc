Spring Shell helps you create Spring-powered, production-grade applications targeting the
_CLI_ space. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing
users can quickly get the bits they need.

You can use Spring Shell to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using
`java -jar` or more sophisticated GraalVM native ways to create platform dependant apps.

Our primary goals are:

* Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for shell development.
* Be opinionated, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.

== Installation and Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of a complete Spring Shell application in Java:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.shell.standard.ShellComponent;
import org.springframework.shell.standard.ShellMethod;

@SpringBootApplication
@ShellComponent
public class DemoApplication {

	@ShellMethod
	public String hi() {
		return "hi";
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}
}
----

Running it as an executable _jar_ in an interactive mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar demo.jar

shell:>help
AVAILABLE COMMANDS

Built-In Commands
       help: Display help about available commands
       stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error.
       clear: Clear the shell screen.
       quit, exit: Exit the shell.
       history: Display or save the history of previously run commands
       version: Show version info
       script: Read and execute commands from a file.

Demo Application
       hi:

shell:>hi
hi
----

Or running it in a non-interactive mode:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar demo.jar hi

hi
----
