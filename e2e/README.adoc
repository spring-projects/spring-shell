= Spring Shell E2E

Testing shell features within unit tests is not always enough to have a full coverage as shell
applications has been traditionally been difficult to test as there is too many moving parts.
While it is relatively easy to test parts of a java code in your `spring-shell` app, knowing those
will actually execute with as run in a hosting environment is a totally different topic. As
`spring-shell` applications can be run on a different environment either a simple `spring-boot` app
via java runtime environment or via `graalvm` build binary many things can simply go wrong.

`spring-shell-e2e` is a node module which uses `node-pty` and `xterm.js` to run your
shell application whether you run shell in any ways as it just assumes a command runs
a shell application. Relationship between `node-pty` and `xterm.js` is that _pty_ environment
is providing underlying host capabilities running shell applications and _xterm_ having
a knowledge to translate all shell command sequences to a representative text.

[NOTE]
====
We chose to use javascript space for e2e framework as it provides a good set of
libraries to work with various environments and is much more close to native a
environment than what we could do from a java space.
====

`spring-shell-e2e-tests` is simply using `spring-shell-e2e` to implement _e2e_ tests and
runs both _fatjar_ and _native_ built apps.

`spring-shell-e2e` is work-in-progress, so it's not yet published into _npmjs_.

Generic workflow to run `spring-shell-e2e-tests` is:

====
[source, bash]
----
spring-shell
$ ./gradlew build -x test

spring-shell/e2e/spring-shell-e2e
$ npm install
$ npm run build

spring-shell/e2e/spring-shell-e2e-tests
$ npm install
$ npm test
